You can use previously done code.


1) Make an accordion instead of the current list.

Each item consists of 3 columns: number, “Click to open fact”, plus sign.
When clicking on the accordion item you will send a fetch request to the cat API,
retrieve information from the API and show it in the opened space. ✅

PLUS sign is changing to a MINUS sign when the accordion item is opened.
Add your images to the opened accordion at the right, text from API will be in the column at the left.
Logo sign should be inverted when hovered on the last item.
Text color on the item should be inverted (changed to a better visible one)
Under each item should be a dividing line, which will be removed on hovering.
If the item is in the middle, you should remove the divider at the top and at the bottom.





2) Add your own design to the page (let your imagination work here).
